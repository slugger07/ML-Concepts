NN algorithm is one of the simplest classification algorithm and it is one of the most used learning algorithms.
KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm.

When we say a technique is non-parametric , it means that it does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution.

KNN is said to be lazy as it does not use the training data points to do any generalization.
In other words, there is no explicit training phase or it is very minimal.
